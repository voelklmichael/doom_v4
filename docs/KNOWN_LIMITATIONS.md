# Known Limitations

Deviations from strict C89 semantics that the parser pipeline (`docs/01_PARSER.md`)
currently accepts as-is, because they don't (yet) affect `linuxdoom-1.10`'s actual
build. Each entry notes why it doesn't matter today and what would need to change
if it ever does.

---

## Wide literals (`L"..."`, `L'...'`) are not lexed as a single token

**Where**: Step 2 partitioning (`transpiler/src/parser/partitioner.rs`), Step 4 lexing
(`transpiler/src/parser/lexer.rs`).

Strict C89 grammar treats `L"foo"` / `L'x'` (a wide string/char literal) as one token.
Our partitioner starts a literal chunk the moment it sees `"` or `'`, without looking
one character back for a preceding `L`. So `L"foo"` would come through as a separate
`Identifier` token (`L`) immediately followed by a `StringLiteral` token (`"foo"`),
rather than one wide-string-literal token.

**Impact today**: none. `linuxdoom-1.10` never uses wide literals (verified: no real
`L"..."`/`L'...'` occurrences in the corpus; the only `L'` hits are apostrophes inside
French string content in `d_french.h`, e.g. `"DONJON DE L'ENFER"`, already consumed
correctly as part of that single string chunk).

**If it starts mattering**: teach the partitioner to check for an immediately
preceding `L` (with no whitespace) before starting a string/char literal chunk, and
fold it into that chunk.

## A comment trailing on the same line as a preprocessor directive is swallowed into the directive's raw text

**Where**: Step 2 partitioning (`transpiler/src/parser/partitioner.rs`).

The directive-scanning branch of `partition_source` reads to end-of-line
unconditionally:

```rust
if at_line_start && b == b'#' {
    ...
    while i < len && bytes[i] != b'\n' && bytes[i] != b'\r' {
        i += 1;   // doesn't stop at "//" or "/*"
    }
    ...
}
```

Unlike the code-scanning branch (which does check for `//`/`/*`), this one doesn't,
so a line like:

```c
#define NCMD_KILL	0x10000000	// kill game   // real example: d_net.c:40
```

becomes a single `SourceChunk::Preprocessor` whose parsed `body` is
`"0x10000000\t// kill game"` — the comment text ends up baked into the macro body
string, and no separate `Comment` chunk is ever created for it. By the time Step 4/5
run, that comment isn't a `Comment` token anywhere in the stream, so it can't be
attached to anything.

**Impact today**: none of the existing pipeline validation catches it, because
round-trip (Step 2) and comment-count (Step 5) tests only check that text is
preserved *somewhere*, not that it's classified correctly. It's cosmetic until
something downstream tries to use `PreprocessorDirective::Define.body` as literal
macro-replacement text (the comment would corrupt it) or wants the comment surfaced
as documentation on the `#define`. Real-world frequency: common — a quick corpus grep
found 7+ macros with trailing same-line comments in the first few hits alone (e.g.
`d_net.c:40`, `i_sound.c:99-100`, `hu_stuff.h:30-42`).

**If it starts mattering**: make the directive-scanning branch stop at an unescaped
`//`/`/*` the same way the code-scanning branch does, splitting off a real `Comment`
chunk (or chunks, for `/* ... */ ... // ...`) instead of folding it into the
directive's raw text.
